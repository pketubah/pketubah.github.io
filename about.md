My name is Mike, and I've recently gotten married, it was a very traditional jewish wedding. We previously lived in Prague, but moved to America and have been here for some years now. I'm a big fan of terriers, or dogs in general for that matter, and I'm also a bit of a techie. I'm dedicated to making [my blog]({{ site.baseurl }}) a nice place to spend time on and learn new things. So take a look at my latest posts and let me know what you think.
