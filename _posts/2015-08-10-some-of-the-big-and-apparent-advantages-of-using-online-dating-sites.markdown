There are some people who are introvert by nature and do not like to share their personal feelings and events of their personal life with other people. Through "dejtingsidor" or an online dating site, it becomes possible for them to meet their prospective partners in private and ensure that no one is looking at them or hearing their conversations with each other. People use webcams, skype and other such online tools for chatting with the other person so that they both can see and hear each other at the same time, almost like a live conversation happening in person but without compromising their privacy.

All this costs a lot of money. By resorting to online dating, this expense can be reduced greatly.
